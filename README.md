# CommandLinePhoneBookApp
The project aims to create a simple command-line phone book application that allows users to add contacts, view all contacts, search for a contact by name, delete contacts, and exit the application. The phone book organizes contacts in a sorted order based on names, providing efficient search and display functionalities.
